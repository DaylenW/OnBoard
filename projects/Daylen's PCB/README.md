# DAYLEN'S PCB PROJECT

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
The board toggles LEDs based on a J-K Flip Flop circuit. This changes based on a clock circuit's rising edge.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Although manufacturing the circuit isn't very expensive the shipping can be $50.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
